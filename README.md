<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Nowadays there are a lot of distractions from the older times so studying in peace or with the right mind is getting harder and harder now. Students as well as the learners who want to learn now want the study to be as fun as possible so that they don’t get bored of it. So we are presenting a way for it.
Providing a 3D Environment with an application or wearable support to get an interaction with the Book they are studying.
One of the solutions that we have in our hands right now is augmented reality. With the help of augmented reality, we can get many possibilities to make anything interesting as possible. As it is a new thing in the market and in the near future and now there is a need to adapt it right now.

So here the idea about what we gonna do:
* Providing a 3D model of the particular thing that they want
* Providing the interactive module to it that is:-
* Zoom in and out
* Moving it accordingly
* Getting a working 3D model
* Eg: If you want a 3D model showing the working of the heart as to how it is moving


A similar example of the app we going to make is :
Pokemon GO: The app comes with the feature to catch a monster/pokemon to interact a little and catch it in argument reality and it was a hit app.

Use the `README.md` to get started.
